                  What job would like to do when you leave education?” Answer = Software Tester, “said nobody ever,” but as most software testers will support becoming one has been one of the best decisions I have ever made.

                  Being an integral part of a team, that helps to deliver Quality, to any product excites me. It is really a joy to do a job where every day, we can make a difference as IT professionals to existing and new products that help achieve and can have endless possibilities.

                  Having worked as a software test professional for over ten years, every day is a school day, and this allows me to feed my enjoyment of learning new skills. Being able to pass this knowledge to the rest of the team, with mentoring and watching individuals grow; there is no better feeling. Currently working as a Test Lead, I have the privilege to do this every day. Another enjoyment within my role, is that I get to on a day-to-day basis, question and challenge the norm and looking for different ways to achieve the same result but in a more efficient manner. Being pragmatic and always looking forward and seeing product progression makes us all proud to do the job we do.
